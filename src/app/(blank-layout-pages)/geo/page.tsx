/* The NextPage type is a type alias for a React component that is a Next.js page.
It includes properties specific to Next.js pages, such as getStaticProps, getServerSideProps,
and others used for data fetching during page rendering.
So, here we create a Next.js page component using TypeScript.
It is defining a constant named Page with the type NextPage.
This is a common pattern when working with Next.js and TypeScript
to ensure type safety and provide better development tooling support. */
